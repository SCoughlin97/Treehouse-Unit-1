<p>I have been attending Denver Pop Culture Convention for the past 3 years. I have made it a yearly taditon and have dressed as Deadpool each year.
</p>
<p>Bartending has been an incredably fun experience for me. It is increadable how a few drinks can lead to the most interesting converstions of your life</p>
<p>I usually play videogames to relax after work or just to burn a few hours if I'm having a lazy day. I always enjoy finding something new to play on my PS4</p>
